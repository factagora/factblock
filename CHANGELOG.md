## 1.0-draft.1 (2026-10-04)

First public draft of the format and the reference library.

- Five invariants (three clocks, attested knowledge time, append-only, typed edges, declared facts) with one validator check id each.
- Logical model: node, edge, resolution, declarations (facts, backfill batches, edge types, embedding model).
- JSONL and Parquet profiles; Parquet files sorted by `known_at`, unknown fields kept in `extra`.
- Read semantics: as-of with certificate, `valid_at` defaulting to `as_of`, supersession, `resolve` by declared policy, expansion.
- Readers: the Python library (`scan`, `validate`, `resolve`, `write_parquet`) and the DuckDB macro pack.
- Writers: the tckg ledger (`GET /v1/export`) and the Graphiti adapter.
