# Changelog

## 1.0-draft.1 (2026-10-04)

First public draft of the format and the reference library.

- Five invariants (three clocks, attested knowledge time, append-only, typed edges, declared facts) with one validator check id each.
- Logical model: node, edge, resolution, declarations (facts, backfill batches, edge types, embedding model).
- JSONL and Parquet profiles; Parquet files sorted by `known_at`, unknown fields kept in `extra`.
- Read semantics: as-of with certificate, `valid_at` defaulting to `as_of`, supersession, `resolve` by declared policy, expansion.
- Readers: the Python library (`scan`, `validate`, `resolve`, `write_parquet`) and the DuckDB macro pack.
- Writers: the tckg ledger (`GET /v1/export`) and the Graphiti adapter.

### Added (2026-10-05)
- `factblock extract`: text in, a batch of blocks out, through a model you choose (`gemini`, `openai`, or `fake` for offline runs). The claims profile lives in `factblock/profiles/claims/` as three files (instructions, output schema, edge types) so other languages run the same extraction. Every extract declares one backfill batch (SPEC 6: a non-ledger writer never invents `known_at`).
- `write_bundle(result, out, append=True)` in `factblock.bundle`: a folder grows one batch at a time and stays valid; entities are reused across batches.
- README rewritten as the project's front door: agent memory for decisions.
